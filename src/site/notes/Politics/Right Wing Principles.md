Right Wing Ideologies:

The Right Wing, often synonymous with conservatism, champions a political philosophy that leans towards **minimal governmental interference**, **staunch [[Individualism\|Individualism]]**, and a reverence for traditional values. Here's an in-depth look at their core beliefs:

  

# Limited Government

Right-wing advocates push for a government that's lean and mean, not in the sense of being cruel, but in terms of size and scope. They believe in giving individuals and businesses the freedom to operate with minimal bureaucratic red tape. It's like saying, "Let people do their thing, and let businesses business without the government playing nanny."

  

# Free Market Capitalism

Imagine an economic playground where the rules are simple: supply and demand call the shots, and businesses play without the government's overbearing supervision. Right-wing thinkers, like the legendary Milton Friedman, argue that this system, free from government tinkering, leads to innovation, efficiency, and prosperity.

  

# Low Taxation

While the left might dream of soaking the rich with taxes, the right sees this as draining the economic engine. They argue that lower taxes for everyone, especially corporations, fuel economic growth. They often refer to the Laffer curve, suggesting there's a sweet spot in tax rates where revenue is maximized.

  

#  Nationalism

Right-wing leaders, like the charismatic Donald Trump, wave the flag of nationalism high. They believe in putting their country first, often with slogans like "Make America Great Again." This isn't just about pride; it's about policies that prioritize national interests, strong military, and secure borders. Across the pond, Europe sees similar sentiments with figures like Marine Le Pen.

  

#  Traditional over Modern Values

When it comes to social issues, the right tends to favor the old school. They're not fans of modern liberal ideas like abortion rights or gender-affirming surgeries, advocating instead for a return to what they see as timeless values. This often puts them at odds with human rights groups over what should be considered fundamental rights.

  

# Tough Law Enforcement

The right believes in law and order with a capital 'L' and 'O'. They advocate for policies that ensure the streets are safe, often through stricter sentencing and robust policing. The "War on Drugs" is a classic example of this hardline approach.

  

# Strong Military and Defense

For the right, national defense isn't just a priority; it's a necessity. They advocate for a military that's not just strong but formidable, often citing historical examples like the Cold War buildup under right-wing leadership. Recent tensions with China under Trump's administration illustrate this hawkish stance.

  

# Individualism

Right-wingers are all about the individual. They believe in personal responsibility and self-reliance, echoing Ayn Rand's Objectivism, which celebrates the individual's pursuit of self-interest as the highest moral purpose.

  

# Deregulation

The right sees government regulations as chains on the ankles of businesses. They push for deregulation, believing that businesses should be free to innovate and compete without the government's heavy hand. The deregulation of the U.S. airline industry is often cited as a success story of this approach.

  

In essence, the Right Wing's philosophy is about "freedom", "tradition", and a robust defense of "national identity" and "economic liberty", all while keeping the government's role to what they believe is its "bare minimum".
