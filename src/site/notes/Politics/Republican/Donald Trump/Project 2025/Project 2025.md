[[Politics/Republican/Donald Trump/Donald Trump\|Donald Trump]] has tried to distance himself from project 2025 in an all too familiar way. 
one thing trump has done consistently has been to pretend he had never heard of someone or something emerging in the media that he knows will be damaging.

[Trump’s Project 2025 Ties Explained—Even As He Distances Himself (archive.is)](https://archive.is/K8eST)


**Public Comments:** Trump publicly cheered the Heritage Foundation’s policy work in the past, [saying](https://archive.is/o/K8eST/https://x.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1811402883604050216 "https://x.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1811402883604050216") in 2022—before Project 2025’s agenda was released—that the organization was “going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do … when the American people give us a colossal mandate.”

**Project 2025 Briefing:** Roberts told the Post in April he had briefed Trump on Project 2025, saying he “personally [has] talked to President Trump about Project 2025 … because my role in the project has been to make sure that all of the candidates who have responded to our offer for a briefing on Project 2025 get one from me.”

**JD Vance:** Roberts has even closer ties to [Vance](https://archive.is/o/K8eST/https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/07/16/trump-wants-distance-from-project-2025-but-heres-how-jd-vance-has-closer-ties/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/07/16/trump-wants-distance-from-project-2025-but-heres-how-jd-vance-has-closer-ties/"), with the Heritage leader telling [Politico](https://archive.is/o/K8eST/https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054 "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/03/15/mr-maga-goes-to-washington-00147054") in March the senator was “absolutely going to be one of the leaders—if not the leader—of our movement” and [saying](https://archive.is/o/K8eST/https://x.com/NYTnickc/status/1812929037636923410 "https://x.com/NYTnickc/status/1812929037636923410") after Vance was named as Trump’s running mate that the Heritage Foundation had been privately “really rooting” for him to be the pick.

**Project 2025 Authors:** More than 140 former members of the Trump administration are involved with Project 2025, according to [CNN](https://archive.is/o/K8eST/https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html "https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html"), including six of his former Cabinet secretaries—and several people authored chapters whom the Post reports Trump has suggested could be in his second administration, including former advisor Peter Navarro, former Housing Secretary Ben Carson and former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.


the Heritage Foundation confirmed it’s still moving forward with its plans to help staff a future Trump administration, which includes 
a LinkedIn-style database for potential federal employees and training programs. It’s less clear what’s happening with the “fourth pillar” of Project 2025, a playbook for the first 180 days of a second Trump presidency. The Heritage Foundation did not respond to a question about whether those efforts were still moving forward, and House Democrats sent a [letter](https://archive.is/o/K8eST/https://huffman.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20Heritage%20Foundation%20on%20Project%202025.pdf "https://huffman.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20Heritage%20Foundation%20on%20Project%202025.pdf") to Roberts on Tuesday asking about the status of the playbook, noting he has “conspicuously declined to publish or disclose” anything about the policy recommendations it’s making as part of that initiative.
