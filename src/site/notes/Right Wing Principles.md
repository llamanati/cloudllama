### **Beliefs of Right Wing**

Right Wing is on the conservative end of the political spectrum. It believes in a limited form of government, free market capitalism, low taxation and a nationalist government. Additionally, right wing calls for stricter immigration law and oppose universal healthcare and education. Here are the beliefs of right wing in detail. 

#### **1) Limited Government**

Right Wing parties favor smaller governments with fewer regulations. They advocate for greater autonomy for individuals and businesses. 

#### **2) Free Market Capitalism**

Right-wing ideologies typically endorse free-market economic systems, where supply and demand determine prices, and businesses operate with minimal government interference. Prominent economist of the right, like Milton Freidman is a strong advocate for free-market capitalism. 

#### **3) Low Taxation**

Unlike left who advocates for higher taxes on the rich, right wingers believe that taxes should be low. They believe that reducing the tax burden on corporations and individuals can help stimulate economic growth. They cite examples like the Laffer curve that illustrates the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue.

#### **4) Nationalism**

Popular leaders on the right, like Donald Trump, champion nationalism. Their claims like ‘Make America great again’ are rooted in a deep believe system that the left criticizes the country too much. Right Wing leaders often prioritize a strong military and controlled borders. Apart from USA, you will also see Right-wing populist movements in Europe, like Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France.

#### **5) Traditional over Modern Values**

Modern and more liberal view points like right to abortion or gender affirmative surgery is highly opposed by the right wingers. They call for more traditional values on social issues and marriage. Currently, USA leaders and human rights organizations are clashing with each other over what constitutes as basic and fundamental human rights. 

#### **6) Tough Law Enforcement**

Right-wing ideologies tend to favor tough law enforcement policies, advocating for stricter sentencing and maintaining order. The “War on Drugs” in the United States is a clear example of this. 

#### **7) Strong Military and Defence**

Realism sits at the heart of right wing ideology. They call for a more robust military and national defense system. Under right wing leaders, USA jacked up its buildup of the U.S. military during the cold war. Moreover, during the tenure of Donald Trump, USA saw a stark increase in conflict and confrontation with China. 

#### **8) Individualism**

Right-wing parties often emphasize individual rights and self-reliance, favoring limited government intervention in personal matters. They are supporters of the Ayn Rand’s philosophy of Objectivism, which promotes individualism.

#### **9) Deregulation**

Right-wing parties often seek to reduce government regulation in industries, allowing businesses more freedom. Reference: The deregulation of the airline industry in the U.S. during the late 20th century.
